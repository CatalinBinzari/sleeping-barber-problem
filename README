CS problem:

A barber goes to work in a barbershop with a waiting room with a fixed number of seats.

If no one is  in the waiting room, the barber goes to sleep.

when a client shows up, if there are no seats available, he or she leaves

if there is a seat available, and the barber is sleeping, the client wakes the barber up and gets a hair cut

if the barber is busy the client takes a seat and waits his or her turn

once the shop closes, no more clients are allowed in, but the barber waits for the everyone who is in to get the hair cut

SCOPE: no mutex and no waiting groups (dont communicate with the sharing memory, share memory by comunicating)
